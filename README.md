# Hamza Rizwan_20297534_Brick Destroy

Refactoring Activities

This project's classes were first and foremost organised into multiple packages in order to avid cluttering. By taking encapsulation into consideration
each and every variables/data was passed to from one class to anther via setter/getters throughout the entire project making this project well intact and encapsulated. Many variable and class names were changed in order to enhance users readability such as the main class previoously named as GraphicsMain was changed into BrickDestroyMain and previously used variables such as Brick Face was changed in BrickBody and data regarding the menu button was changed into exit button as it was performing the action of exiting the system in HomeMenu class
